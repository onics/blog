<h3>Deep and Dark: Differences between the hidden webs</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding the difference between the Deep and Dark nets. Is there even a difference?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, a quite substantial difference separates these two hidden aspects of the public world wide web: the difference lies largely with intent. However, I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. Let's start with a small introduction to internet culture. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The internet, originally (D)ARPANET, was invented and funded by the U.S. military (specifically the U.S. Navy). It started as a means to provide more reliable communication in the face of potential disaster (according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET#ARPANET">Wikipedia</a>), and always incorporated the work of large research institutions and public universities. It was the universities that were largely responsible for molding the internet into the behemoth of information-sharing that it has become today. The ability to share research in a well-formatted, easily-accessible format led to the internet's widespread adoption among academics. Diving into this background helps to elucidate the distinction between the Deep web and its Darker cousin. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Google, AskJeeves, Yahoo or any of the other search engines, it was exceedingly more difficult to find information on the internet. It was akin to walking into the Library of Congress trying to find a specific title without having so much as a card catalogue. Unless you already knew pretty much exactly what you were looking for, you were unlikely to find it. With the introduction of search engines, people could now type in something that looked close to natural language to find desired information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early days of the search engine, you still had to know a bit about the topic you were investigating. Several mystical incantations and face-slams on the keyboard later: "magic!", you have your information. <p>Since those dark days, search engines have become significantly more sophisticated. They almost seem to give you answers to questions you didn't even know you wanted to ask. Ok, that's a bit of hyperbole, but they're damn good. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This brings us back to the original topic: the difference between the Deep and Dark web. Hiding beneath the superficial, lies a plethora of information and knowledge incapable of being indexed by the ethereal robots servicing popular search engines. For this treasure trove, we once again need specialized tools to gather information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have ever looked into discovering more about the Deep/Dark web, you have probably come across the "Iceberg" metaphor. The metaphor starts with likening the normal web, searched by popular search engines as the tip of the iceberg. What lies below the surface of the water is the bulk of the iceberg, the Deep/Dark web, which out-masses the visible tip by a longshot. This is an apt visual metaphor, but it falls short in illuminating the difference between the Deep and Dark web. Rather, let's use the metaphor of a Deep and Dark person (no racism implied, calm down SJWs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Deep and Dark people tend to be quiet about themselves, keeping important information close, not freely sharing it with the casual passerby. Both require work, and a certain degree of added trust to gain the good nuggets of info. What separates the two is the intent of keeping that information hidden. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Deep person is generally benevolent, or at the least ethically neutral. The knowledge of a Deep person may be guarded, but more often than not to protect it from falling into the hands of Dark people or the uninitiated. What we were told in school is true: knowledge (read information) is power. People live and die, save and kill over critical information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stepping back from the extremes, some information can also be harmful if disclosed too publicly. Did you receive medical treatment for an STD last July? Maybe now your employer finds this information and decides to fire such a sexual deviant. No judgement here for contracting an STD, but those kind of decisions are made in the modern workplace, regardless of their propriety. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Deep web allows for the specialized investigation of topics of interest: insurance claims, background checks, criminal records, scholarly articles/journals, news sites, business deals/mergers, journalist/whistleblower information drops, etc. Like a Deep person, the Deep web is not just going to cough up its most valuable information, you have to work a bit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, part of what leads to confusion between the Deep and Dark web is that some of the same tools/techniques are used on both. <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> and <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">I2P</a> are out-of-band networks that utilize the same infrastructure as the clear-web (what's accesible from a normal browser). Both Tor and I2P use encryption and complex routing to protect their users' security and privacy. Just as a knife can be used to chop carrots or fingers, these technologies can be used in helpful and harmful ways. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, please remember to look for intent the next time you hear someone using Deep and Dark web interchangeably. Is someone searching for news articles their government is consoring (Deep web), or are they trying to find the latest, greatest price on a pound of drugs (Dark web)? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and hopefully this piece has helped clarify the differences between the Deep/Dark web. If I have made any mistakes, or you would like me to add something, please feel free to say so in the comments. </p>
